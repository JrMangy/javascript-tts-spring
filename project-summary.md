# Project Summary by Ronnie Stevenson
## __What I have learned from doing this Project:__

## __1. Some people are much better at some aspects of JS and CSS than others.__
As a whole, if 100% means that the whole class gets everything, and 0% means ground zero, we are at about 60-70% so far. Including myself, we reference a lot of previous material in creating our own. Whether that is by design or just an outcome, I cannot say. I do know that this may be a hinderance later on, but I guess I will have to wait and see.

## __2. I have to do more, not only for myself, but also for others.__
I came into this program with a decent head start above people. Knowing that, I have not been trying as hard as I know I can. This project has shown me that I need to step my game up, and not only for my sake. I go out of my way to help people sometimes because I genuinely get joy out of that. It would be hard for me to help people if I have to constantly look for answers myself.

## __3. Overall, the project went great!__
Being able to see the ideas that others came up with was amazing. It was good to be a part of a project from the beginning, and see how the many small changes along the way came together into a bigger picture project. It was also good to see how all the other groups achieved different outcomes on the same project. It was an inspiration to see the different types of things that can be done.

## 4. It was good for the growth of my communication skills.
From my group, the only person I really communicated with prior was Tiquila. Evan seems to be a loner, which works for him because he is very intelligent in these topics. Deepti is a good team player, but I think she gets frustrated when she doesn't understand certain concepts, and starts to shut down. By doing this project, I developed ways to communicate with both of them to keep the group together, while also asking for help, when needed.

# What I did well:
- Keep a steady line of communication, so that all of my intentions were clear and achieveable.
- Ask for help, when needed.
- Keep team members up to date with where we were in the process.

# What I can do better next time:
- Be more active in all parts of the creative process, so that no one feels overwhelmed by the tasks given to them.
- Do more that what is just required. Don't become content with what is asked for.
- Not necessarily become __the__ leader, but be more vocal, as someone that can be leaned on.
